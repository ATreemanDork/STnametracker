(index):1 The Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header has been ignored, because the URL's origin was untrustworthy. It was defined either in the final response or a redirect. Please deliver the response using the HTTPS protocol. You can also use the 'localhost' origin instead. See https://www.w3.org/TR/powerful-features/#potentially-trustworthy-origin and https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-cross-origin-opener-policy-header.
(index):1 The page requested an origin-keyed agent cluster using the Origin-Agent-Cluster header, but could not be origin-keyed since the origin 'http://192.168.0.4:8008' had previously been placed in a site-keyed agent cluster.

debug-parser.js:26 [NT-DEBUG-RAW] First 500 chars: <think>I'll analyze these messages to extract character information and create the required JSON response. Let me go through this step by step.

From the messages, I can identify several characters:

1. **John** - The user character who is the protagonist and narrator
2. **Jasmine** - A Black student who appears to be lactating
3. **Maya** - A half-Filipino girl who seems to have the same condition as Jasmine
4. **Chloe** - A tall Black girl also experiencing the condition
5. **Sarah** - A red-h

}
debug-parser.js:28 [NT-DEBUG-RAW] Full response:
debug-parser.js:29 <think>I'll analyze these messages to extract character information and create the required JSON response. Let me go through this step by step.

From the messages, I can identify several characters:

1. **John** - The user character who is the protagonist and narrator
2. **Jasmine** - A Black student who appears to be lactating
3. **Maya** - A half-Filipino girl who seems to have the same condition as Jasmine
4. **Chloe** - A tall Black girl also experiencing the condition
5. **Sarah** - A red-haired girl with the same condition
6. **Ling** - A Chinese exchange student who also appears to be affected

Let me extract the information for each character:

**John:**
- The protagonist and narrator
- He is helping Jasmine who seems to be in pain
- He's concerned enough to offer to help her home and even offered to get medication
- He noticed Jasmine's condition when he called out to her
- He offered his arm for support
- He seems to understand what might be happening with Jasmine's condition

**Jasmine:**
- A Black girl with flawless dark ebony skin
- Tall and statuesque build
- Powerfully toned legs
- Heart-shaped bubble butt
- DD-cup breasts that are currently lactating
- Normally confident but currently panicked and embarrassed
- Lives in the north quad dorm
- Appears to be in significant pain
- Seeking John's help

**Maya:**
- Petite half-Filipino girl
- Mocha skin
- Long, glossy black hair in a messy bun
- Small A-cup breasts
- Also appears to be lactating and in pain

**Chloe:**
- Tall, statuesque Black girl
- Deep chocolate skin
- Tight, natural curls
- Wears an oversized band t-shirt and leggings
- Powerful thighs and large butt
- Also experiencing the condition

**Sarah:**
- Pale-skinned red-haired girl with freckles
- C-cup breasts that appear to have grown
- Struggling with backpack straps
- Also experiencing the condition

**Ling:**
- Petite Chinese exchange student
- Delicate features and shy demeanor
- Small, nubile frame
- Small breasts with damp front of blouse
- Also appears to be affected

Now I need to determine which of these characters have NEW information. Since this is the first analysis, all characters mentioned in the messages are new to the lorebook, so I'll include them all. I'll also make sure to include John as required.

For relationships, I can identify that Jasmine and John appear to be developing a relationship - she's seeking his help and leaning on him for support. John has offered to help her home and showed concern for her condition.

Let me format this as the required JSON:</think>

- She wants to have unprotected sex with John

Message 10:
- John commands Jasmine to remove her pants
- He refers to her as "slut"
- He mentions her "ass"

Let me extract the relevant information for each character:

For Jasmine:
- Age: Unknown (not explicitly mentioned in these messages)
- Physical: Tall, statuesque Black girl with flawless dark ebony skin, powerful legs, heart-shaped bubble butt that strains against yoga pants, DD-cup breasts that leak milk
- Personality: Panicked and embarrassed at the start, then becomes more willing and open to sexual activities. She has a transformation from embarrassed to more sexually open and assertive.
- Sexuality: Becomes more sexually active and assertive, but no explicit orientation mentioned
- Race/Ethnicity: Black
- Relationships:
  * Jasmine, John, friend
  * Jasmine, John, person seeking help
  * Jasmine, John, person John helps milk
  * Jasmine, John, sexual partner

For John:
- Age: Unknown (not explicitly mentioned)
- Physical: No detailed description in these messages
- Personality: Helpful, concerned for Jasmine, then becomes more dominant and assertive in sexual scenarios
- Sexuality: Not explicitly mentioned
- Race/Ethnicity: Not mentioned
- Relationships:
  * John, Jasmine, helpful friend
  * John, Jasmine, person offering support
  * John, Jasmine, person who helps milk Jasmine

Now let me formulate this into the requested JSON format:

For Jasmine:
- Name: "Jasmine"
- Aliases: None mentioned, so []
- PhysicalAge: Unknown, so null
- MentalAge: Unknown, so null
- Physical: "Tall, statuesque Black girl with flawless dark ebony skin, powerful legs, heart-shaped bubble butt that strains against yoga pants, DD-cup breasts that are leaking"
- Personality: "Usually confident and self-assured but currently panicking and vulnerable due to the lactation issue. Later becomes more sexually open and assertive."
- Sexuality: "Unknown but becomes more sexually open and assertive after consuming her own milk"
- RaceEthnicity: "Black"
- RoleSkills: null
- Relationships: ["Jasmine is to John: friend, person seeking help", "Jasmine is to John: sexual partner", "Jasmine is to John: person John helps milk"]
- Confidence: 85

For John:
- Name: "John"
- Aliases: None mentioned, so []
- PhysicalAge: Unknown, so null
- MentalAge: Unknown, so null
- Physical: "No detailed description provided"
- Personality: "Helpful, concerned for Jasmine's wellbeing. Later becomes more dominant and assertive in sexual scenarios."
- Sexuality: "Unknown"
- RaceEthnicity: "Unknown"
- RoleSkills: null
- Relationships: ["John is to Jasmine: helpful friend", "John is to Jasmine: person offering support", "John is to Jasmine: person who helps milk Jasmine", "John is to Jasmine: sexual partner"]
- Confidence: 85

Let me check this against the requirements:
- Include only characters from the lorebook that have new information (both Jasmine and John are included)
- Include the user character (John) always
- Return ONLY a JSON object
- Use the specified format
- Include only new information not in the lorebook

The new information for Jasmine includes:
- Her becoming more sexually open and assertive
- Her having an orgasm while being milked
- Her asking John to taste her milk
- Her wanting unprotected sex

The new information for John includes:
- Him becoming more dominant and assertive in sexual scenarios
- Him helping to milk Jasmine
- Him having sexual contact with Jasmine
- Him being affected by the aphrodisiac milk

Now I'll format this as the required JSON object.</think>

From the Current Lorebook Entries, I see:

debug-parser.js:29 <think>I need to carefully analyze these messages to identify character information and update the lorebook accordingly. Let me examine the messages for new information about John and Jasmine.

From the Current Lorebook Entries, I see:
- Jasmine: Physical description includes tall, statuesque Black girl with flawless dark ebony skin, powerful legs, heart-shaped bubble butt, DD-cup breasts that are leaking. Personality shows she's usually confident but currently panicking due to lactation issue. Relationships include various dynamics with John.
- John: Physical description is minimal, personality shows he's helpful and concerned for Jasmine's wellbeing. Relationships show he's a helpful friend to Jasmine.

Now let me review the messages for new information:

Message 1: John withdraws his cock and then thrusts back in, squeezing Jasmine's milky tits. This shows new physical action between the characters but no new character information.

Message 2: Contains extensive descriptions of Jasmine's reactions, including her desperate begging, her body's responses, and the lactation issue being described in more detail. This adds substantial new information about Jasmine's physical state and emotional state during the encounter.

Message 3: John places hands on Jasmine's hips, slaps her ass, and compliments her appearance with "Gods, you are beautiful, Jasmine." This provides new physical information about John and new relationship dynamics.

Message 4: More detail about Jasmine's reactions, including her brash confidence, vulnerability when praised, and her request for John to squeeze her breasts. This provides additional personality traits for both characters.

Message 5: John manhandles Jasmine and kisses her while reentering her. More physical action but no new character information.

Based on this analysis, I need to update:
1. Jasmine's personality (adding her brash confidence and vulnerable moments)
2. Jasmine's physical description (adding more about her muscular hips and her confidence in her body)
3. John's physical description (adding that he has strong hands)
4. John's personality (adding his physical actions during sex)
5. Relationship dynamics (new sexual dominant/submissive aspects)

Let me create the JSON response with this new information:

For Jasmine:
- New personality traits: brash confidence, vulnerability when praised, desire for dominance/submission
- Physical details: muscular hips
- Relationships with John: sexual submissive, lover (these were partially mentioned but with more detail now)

For John:
- New physical description: strong hands
- New personality traits: assertive during sex, dominant, appreciative of Jasmine's beauty
- Relationships with Jasmine: sexual dominant, lover (these were partially mentioned but with more detail now)</think>

debug-parser.js:29 <think>The user wants me to extract character information from messages and return only a JSON object.

Let me carefully analyze the messages to identify new information about characters, particularly focusing on any changes or additions to the existing lorebook entries for Jasmine and John.

**Looking at the lorebook entries:**

Current information for:
- Jasmine: Physical description, personality, race/ethnicity, some relationships
- John: Personality, some roles, some relationships

**Analyzing the messages for new information:**

Looking through all messages carefully:

**For Jasmine:**
- Message 1: John compliments her as "beautiful, sexy, strong woman" - new insight into how he perceives her
- Message 2: Shows her vulnerability to genuine compliments vs. crude comments. Reveals her usual response to crude comments like "suck that dick, slut" or "gag on it, bitch". Shows she doesn't do relationships. Shows she's confused by his genuine approach.
- Message 4: Shows her vulnerability is real, and she questions if being treated like a slut sometimes is part of who she is. She's testing if his respect is conditional.
- Message 6: Shows she helps other girls on the team (new information!), reveals more about her personality shift during the intimate interaction, shows her bratty behavior transitioning to genuine pleasure.
- Message 8: Shows her reactions to sex, verbal communication during sex.
- Message 10: Shows her intense pleasure response, begging, complete surrender to the experience.

**New information about Jasmine:**
1. She helps other girls on the team (revealed in message 6)
2. Her usual response to crude comments like "suck that dick, slut" or "gag on it, bitch" (revealed in message 2)
3. Her confusion about whether being treated like a slut is part of who she is (message 4)
4. More detailed personality shifts during intimacy - from defensive/vulnerable to completely surrendered pleasure (messages 6, 8, 10)
5. Verbal communication style during sex (message 8)
6. Begging and surrender during intense pleasure (message 10)

**For John:**
- Message 1: Shows his direct compliment style
- Message 3: Shows his protective/defensive side - doesn't want her to tolerate disrespect
- Message 5: Shows his understanding approach - she can be a slut with him, emphasizes friendship first. Shows he's seen her helping other team members. Shows he understands some men see her as a sexual trophy.
- Message 7: Shows his dominant but encouraging role during sex
- Message 9: Shows his more dominant/aggressive side during sex, using her body
- Message 10: Shows his possessive, dominant approach - feeding her body cock, fucking through orgasms, biting to mark her

**New information about John:**
1. He has seen her helping other girls on the team (message 5)
2. He understands some men see her as a sexual trophy (message 5)
3. His verbal communication style during sex - encouraging, dominant (messages 7, 9)
4. His possessive, dominant sexual behavior - feeding her body cock, fucking through orgasms, biting (message 9)
5. His focus on friendship first, sexual partner second (message 5)

**Key points to extract:**

For Jasmine:
- Physical: Already has detailed physical description from lorebook
- Personality: More detailed - usually responds to crude comments with "suck that dick, slut" or "gag on it, bitch", vulnerable to genuine compliments, helps other team members, shifts from defensive to completely surrendered during intimacy
- Relationships: New insights - she's testing if John's respect is conditional, shows she doesn't "do relationships"
- Sexuality: More information about her sexual communication style and preferences
- Role/Skills: "helps other girls on the team"

For John:
- Personality: More detailed - protective, wants to prevent disrespect, emphasizes friendship first, possessive during sex
- Role/Skills: More detailed sexual role - dominant, encouraging, uses her body, fucks through orgasms, possesses
- Relationships: Better understanding of his approach to their relationship - friendship first, sexual partner second, no conditions
- Physical description: Still no detailed physical description provided in messages
- Sexuality: More information about his sexual communication style and preferences

Let me structure this into JSON format following the requirements:

debug-parser.js:28 [NT-DEBUG-RAW] Full response:
debug-parser.js:29 <think>Alright, let's carefully analyze these messages to extract character information for Jasmine and John. I need to look for any new information about their characteristics, relationships, or dynamics.

First, let me review the existing lorebook entries:

For Jasmine:
- Physical: tall, statuesque Black girl with flawless dark ebony skin, powerful legs, heart-shaped bubble butt that strains against yoga pants, DD-cup breasts that are leaking
- Personality: bratty but vulnerable, defensive exterior that crumbles under genuine respect, secretly enjoys being dominated but also values genuine respect, has been hurt by past disrespectful treatment, confused by sincere compliments, enjoys dirty talking during sex, enthusiastic during oral sex once comfortable
- Sexuality: bisexual
- Race/Ethnicity: Black
- Relationship to John: lover, friend, person seeking help, person offering milk, sexual submissive

For John:
- Personality: helpful, concerned for Jasmine's wellbeing, commanding, dominant, sexual dominant, respectful of Jasmine's strength and personhood
- Sexuality: straight
- RoleSkills: sexual dominant, milk extractor, blowjob receiver
- Relationship to Jasmine: helpful friend, person offering support, milk extractor, sexual dominant, lover

Now let me analyze the new messages for additional information:

From the messages, I see that:
1. Jasmine appears to be experiencing a virus that's causing breast milk production (DD-cup breasts that are leaking)
2. There's an ongoing conversation about unprotected sex and potential pregnancy
3. Their relationship seems to be evolving from purely physical to something more emotional/romantic
4. There appears to be more vulnerability in their interaction
5. Jasmine's personality is being further developed - we see her vulnerable side emerging

For Jasmine, I notice:
- Her personality is more complex than the lorebook suggests. The messages show she has a vulnerable side beneath her defensive exterior, which becomes apparent when she feels respected.
- There seems to be a virus causing breast milk production and affecting her behavior.
- She has moments of deep vulnerability where her defenses completely crumble.
- She enjoys being dominated but also values genuine respect.
- There's a fear of pregnancy but also a thrill at the risk.

For John, I notice:
- He appears genuinely concerned for Jasmine's wellbeing.
- He's able to offer emotional connection alongside physical dominance.
- He shows respect for Jasmine as a person.
- He's comfortable being vulnerable and emotionally open.

Let me compile the new information:

Jasmine:
- Physical: DD-cup breasts that are leaking (mentioned in lorebook as new detail), possibly experiencing some kind of viral infection that's causing these symptoms
- Personality: More vulnerability revealed beyond the defensive brattiness, can become deeply vulnerable, has moments of clarity where her walls completely come down, confused by genuine compliments, values respect but also enjoys submission, experiencing complex emotions around potential pregnancy
- Relationship: The dynamic seems to be evolving to something more emotional/romantic beyond physical

debug-parser.js:29 <think>Looking at these messages, I need to extract new character information while following the strict JSON formatting requirements.

Key characters from current lorebook:
- Jasmine: Already has extensive info
- John: Already has info as user character

New character appearing:
- Jade: Introduced in message 5, described in messages 7-10

New information to include:
1. Jade's physical description
2. Jade's personality traits
3. Jade's relationships
4. Any new relationship dynamics involving existing characters

Let me extract this information:

From message 5:
- "Jade is the girl in the showers. She's an athletic, slim, asian girl, wirey and lithe, with perky c-cup tits (before virus). Sexually active, but still innocent (before virus). Very naive and trusting. Worships Jasmine as a senior teammate."

From message 7:
- More description of her physical state: "small, perky breasts," "dark, bruised-looking brown areolas," "swollen and distended, weeping thin streams of milk"

From message 8:
- Her reaction to seeing John: "eyes go wide as she takes in my naked form. My muscular body and huge cock triggering something in her hormonal brain and her lactation begins again"

From message 9:
- Her emotional state: "utterly lost, her entire world shattered," "silent question hanging in the air"
- Her relationship dynamic with Jasmine: "her idol, her captain. She needs guidance, and she needs it desperately"

From messages 9 & 10:
- Introduction to John: Jasmine introducing him as "a friend. A good guy"
- John's offer of help: "we'll see if we can help you feel better"

New relationships to capture:
- Jade is to Jasmine: teammate, junior teammate, worshipper, person seeking guidance
- Jade is to John: new acquaintance, person seeking help
- Jasmine is to Jade: senior teammate, leader, comforter

Physical description: Athletic, slim, Asian, wiry and lithe, C-cup breasts that are now larger and leaking milk, dark areolas, swollen nipples, petite frame

Personality: Naive, trusting, innocent (before virus), easily frightened, desperate for guidance, worshipful toward Jasmine

I'll format this as the required JSON structure.</think>

debug-parser.js:29 <think>Okay, let me analyze this conversation to extract character information. The user wants me to extract character information from the messages and return ONLY a JSON object. I need to look for new information about the characters mentioned in these messages.

Looking at the messages, I see there are three characters mentioned: Jasmine, Jade, and John (the user character).

For John: The user is always included, so I'll include John with any available details.

For Jasmine: I see in the message that she's being milked by John, and there seems to be some interaction with Jade. But I don't see any fundamentally new information about Jasmine that wasn't already in the lorebook entry. She's still the tall, statuesque Black girl with DD breasts that leak, with the same personality traits mentioned before.

For Jade: This is more interesting. In these messages, Jade is clearly introduced as a new character. She's an athletic, slim Asian girl who was previously with C-cup breasts (now larger). From the messages, I can extract:
- She's described as "athletic, slim, asian girl, wirey and lithe, with perky c-cup tits (before virus)"
- She's described as "sexually active, but still innocent (before virus), very naive and trusting"
- She appears to have the virus that's affecting her breasts and body
- She's nervous and hesitant about joining the shower, clearly affected by the situation
- She eventually gives in and asks for help

I don't see any fundamentally new information about John or Jasmine that wasn't already in the lorebook entries. But for Jade, I'm seeing a clear introduction of this character for the first time in these messages, so I should include her.

Let me structure this according to the required JSON format, making sure I follow all the strict formatting rules:
- Use double quotes for all property names
- Use double quotes for all string values
- No markdown, no explanations
- No XML tags
- Follow the exact structure specified

For Jade, I'll need to include her full name (which appears to be just "Jade" based on the messages), her physical description, personality, and any new relationships I can identify.</think>

Message 10: No new character details beyond physical descriptions

The current lorebook has: Jasmine, John, Jade
The new characters introduced are: Rosa and Dora

For John, the user character mentioned: Message 10 shows him sitting up and saying "I'm the one who helped bring out Jasmine's inner slut" - this shows he takes credit for Jasmine's transformation and is active in this dynamic.

Let me extract:

Rosa:
- Name: Rosa
- Physical: Swedish exchange student, blonde, "massive rack and wide hips", covered in milk, "platinum-blonde hair", "huge, gravity-defying breasts", "pale" skin, "busty blonde"
- Personality: blunt, no shame, curious, described as "statuesque Swedish goddess", "practiced and efficient" at milking
- Sexuality: implied bisexual (was with Dora)
- Race/Ethnicity: Swedish
- RoleSkills: exchange student, described as having "massive cannons" (breasts), expert milker
- Relationships:
  - "Rosa is to Jasmine: nursing partner, milk source, sexual partner"
  - "Rosa is to Dora: roommate, sexual partner, nursing partner"
  - "Rosa is to John: observer, potential participant"

Dora:
- Name: Dora
- Physical: Latina, teammate, "leaner, more athletic, with olive skin", freckles, "C-cups", "covered in milk", "swollen lips", "distinct glisten on her chin and neck"
- Personality: described as "bi-curious", "no reservations", "no shame left, only desire", "fascinated"
- Sexuality: implied bisexual (was with Rosa)
- Race/Ethnicity: Latina
- RoleSkills: teammate, described as having been "nursing from Rosa's breasts", sexual activities
- Relationships:
  - "Dora is to Jasmine: teammate, observer, potential participant"
  - "Dora is to Rosa: roommate, sexual partner, nursing partner"
  - "Dora is to Jade: teammate, potential partner"
  - "Dora is to John: observer, potential participant"

John (user character):
- New info: Message 10 shows he "helped bring out Jasmine's inner slut" and "Jade joined in later", positioning himself as the catalyst/alpha.
- Physical: no new description
- Personality: dominant, "helped bring out" suggests influence/control over Jasmine's transformation
- RoleSkills: sexual dominant, catalyst of events, described as "really good at this" by Jade
- Relationships:
  - "John is to Jasmine: catalyst, sexual dominant, partner"
  - "John is to Jade: sexual partner, described as "really good"
  - "John is to Rosa: potential partner"
  - "John is to Dora: potential partner"

I'll include all characters with new information, maintaining consistency with the established lorebook format and highlighting their evolving dynamics.</think>

Key points I need to consider:
1. I need to include John (user character) even if minimal info
2. Only include characters with NEW information compared to the Current Lorebook Entries
3. Characters mentioned but with no new info should NOT be included

Current Lorebook characters: Jasmine, John, Jade, Rosa, Dora

debug-parser.js:29 <think>Alright, so I need to analyze these messages and extract any new information about characters to include in my JSON response. Let me go through these messages carefully.

Key points I need to consider:
1. I need to include John (user character) even if minimal info
2. Only include characters with NEW information compared to the Current Lorebook Entries
3. Characters mentioned but with no new info should NOT be included

Current Lorebook characters: Jasmine, John, Jade, Rosa, Dora

Let me analyze each message for new information:

Message 1:
- Dora is being commanded/controlled
- Describes Dora's physical reaction and submission
- Describes John's actions toward Dora
- NEW relationship: Dora is to John: sexual submissive

Message 2:
- Describes sexual interaction between John and Dora
- No new character info, just continuation

Message 3:
- Similar to Message 1, describing Dora's submission to John
- Describes their sexual interaction
- No new character info

Message 4:
- Reveals Dora's background about previous sexual experiences
- Shows her being penetrated by John
- Shows her thoughts about joining the others in submission to John
- NEW relationship: Dora is to John: sexual submissive, potentially breeding target
- NEW personality aspect: Dora is experiencing submission and becoming devoted

Message 5:
- Describes Dora's internal thoughts about her experiences
- Shows her being penetrated and losing control
- Shows her realization that she's joining the others in submission
- NEW personality aspect: Dora is experiencing submission, becoming devoted acolyte

Message 6:
- Describes their sexual interaction further
- Shows Dora's physical reaction
- Mentions other women watching (Jasmine, Rosa, Jade)
- No new character info for those, just continuation

Message 7:
- Describes Dora's experience during sex with John
- Shows her submission and pleasure
- Shows other women reacting/observing
- No new character info

Message 8:
- Describes John penetrating Dora anally
- Shows her orgasm
- NEW personality aspect: Dora experiencing intense pleasure/pleasure seeking

Message 9:
- Describes Dora's reaction to the anal penetration
- Shows her intense pleasure
- Shows her surrender to John
- NEW personality aspect: Dora experiencing submission, pleasure seeking

Message 10:
- Describes Dora's continued pleasure
- Shows her mind unraveling
- NEW personality aspect: Dora experiencing submission, mind unraveling

Let me check if any of the other characters got new info:

- Jasmine: No new information mentioned
- Jade: No new information mentioned
- Rosa: No new information mentioned

So I only have updates for:
1. John (user character, include regardless)
2. Dora (got new relationship and personality info)

Now let me organize the info for my JSON response:

For John:
- Name: John (using most common name)
- No new physical description
- Personality: Already described as commanding, dominant
- Relationships: Add new relationships with Dora

For Dora:
- Name: Dora
- Physical: Already described as leaner athletic form with olive skin
- Personality: Add new aspects - experiencing submission, becoming devoted acolyte, pleasure-seeking
- Relationships: Add new relationship with John as sexual submissive
- Also add her relationship dynamics with others mentioned

Wait, I should note in relationships that the other women are watching, but that doesn't constitute a new relationship dynamic for them since they're just observers.

Let me structure this properly according to the required format:

 <think>Looking at the conversation between John and the women, I see several characters with new information:

1. John Blackwood - appears throughout
2. Jasmine - has new personality info about submissive kink
3. Rosa - discusses breeding kink, mentions physical changes (tastes, muscle tone)
4. Dora - admits breeding kink, takes charge physically, emotional changes

Let me extract the key new details:

- Observes physical changes in women
- Notes: muscle control, eye changes, hip/ass changes, tongue changes
- Reacts to breeding conversations

**Jasmine Monroe:**
- New personality trait: reveals she has a "little submissive kink" that the collar situation brings out
- Blushes about this
- Admits collar makes her feel "fuzzy" - a relief from being in charge
- Gets more enthusiastic about cocksucking when this is discussed
- Physical: admits having had milk production issues that are now manageable
- Admits enjoying sensitivity and feelings

**Rosa:**
- New personality changes: mentions aggression and competitiveness softening
- New emotional state: fear replaced by "contentment" and "acceptance"
- New behaviors: mentions increased bonding, trust, family/pack mentality
- Notes increased skin contact needs
- Mentions oxytocin bonding theory
- Reveals "breeding kink" - finds pregnancy fantasy "intense"
- Physical changes noted: muscle tone definition, back pain gone, 4-5 sleep hours sufficient
- Physical: increased sensitivity, constant arousal, always wet
- Physical: tastes/flavors more intense
- Mentions new sexual fluid tastes
- Admits collar acceptance

**Dora:**
- New personality changes: competitive spirit less about domination, more about "expression/joy"
- Mentions increased laughter and singing
- Emotional: "spirited" but less aggressive
- Physical: admits wanting John to "fuck a baby in her" - breeding desire
- Physical: stopped moving unconsciously when breeding mentioned
- Shows embarrassment/confession about breeding fantasy
- Takes physical charge by jumping on John's cock
- Emotional: admits to wanting children now when she never did before
- Physical: shows nipple manipulation (like Jasmine did)

1. John (the user character) is showing new personality traits:
   - Becoming philosophical and strategic about the future
   - Taking on a leadership role in planning for the post-virus world
   - Expressing complex emotions about the family unit

2. Jasmine shows new developments:
   - Dawning realization and slutty acceptance of the sexual dynamics
   - Willing participation in the group activities
   - Conflicts with Dora but with affection

3. Dora shows significant new personality traits:
   - Taking charge as a leader
   - Confidence and assertiveness in sexual situations
   - Competitive streak with her sister
   - Planning activities for morale

4. Rosa is observing with a serene smile, showing she's comfortable with the new reality

5. The twins (Sarah and Maya) show significant changes:
   - From shy and nervous to confident and enthusiastic
   - Comfortable with sexual activities
   - Technical skills with setting up the sybian

6. Jesse is becoming more active and participating

7. Jade is participating in nursing from Jasmine

8. Kaylee is mentioned joining in

Let me extract the new information for each character:

**John/John Blackwood:**
New information: Planning strategy for post-virus world, leadership in family unit, philosophical approach, taking on "plow" role in sexual dynamics

**Jasmine/Jasmine Monroe:**
New information: Willing participation, dawning slutty realization, nursing with Jade, comfortable with group dynamics

**Dora:**
New information: Taking charge, confident sexual leadership, competitive with sister, planning "Operation: Populate the New World", assertive behavior

**Sarah/Maya (twins):**
New information: From shy to confident, technical skills with sybian, sexual enthusiasm, "energetic cum dumpsters"

**Jade:**
New information: Nursing from Jasmine, participating in sexual activities

**Kaylee:**
New information: Joining in activities, showing comfort with role

**Jesse:**
New information: More active participation, "walking hard-ons" comment

**Rosa:**
New information: Observing with serene smile, comfortable with situation

I need to be careful to only include characters that have NEW information in these messages. Some characters from the lorebook like Sarah Chen and Maya Chen appear but don't provide new information beyond what's already in the lorebook.

Let me structure this according to the required JSON format.</think>

debug-parser.js:28 [NT-DEBUG-RAW] Full response:
debug-parser.js:29 I need to analyze the messages for character updates. Let me go through each message carefully to identify new information about characters:

Message 1: Sexual interaction between John and Jasmine. No new character information beyond what's already in the lorebook.

Message 2: Describes sexual scene between John and Jasmine with Jade nursing. No new character information beyond what's already in the lorebook.

Message 3: Command to Jasmine about Jade. No new character information beyond what's already in the lorebook.

Message 4: Jasmine's confession about wanting to be bred/bred by John. This shows a new aspect of her personality - her desire to have children despite previous anti-child stance, and her vulnerability/shame in admitting this desire.

Message 5: Command to Jade to spread legs for Jasmine. No new character information beyond what's already in the lorebook.

Message 6: Jade presents her pussy to Jasmine, who eats her out while John has sex with Jasmine. John spanks Jasmine and compliments her ass. No new character information beyond what's already in the lorebook.

Message 7: Describes sexual scene and John talking dirty to Jasmine. No new character information beyond what's already in the lorebook.

Message 8: Jade has an orgasm from Jasmine's cunnilingus. No new character information beyond what's already in the lorebook.

Message 9: John moves Jasmine to a reverse cowgirl position and continues having sex with her while she orgasms multiple times. Describes Jasmine as "onahole" (male sex toy) and "fucked silly." No new character information beyond what's already in the lorebook.

Message 10: John continues having sex with Jasmine in the reverse cowgirl position while she orgasms repeatedly. Jade joins in by sucking on Jasmine's clit. John whispers encouragement to Jasmine. No new character information beyond what's already in the lorebook.

So the only new information appears in Message 4 about Jasmine's confession about wanting to be bred. This is already captured in the lorebook as: "new: admits to having breeding thoughts about John despite lifelong opposition to children" and "new: experiences emotional breakthrough when confessing love, becomes vulnerable and openly emotional".

Let me check if there are any other characters mentioned who need updating:

- John: Still sexually dominant, orchestrating activities. No new personality information.
- Jade: Still submissive, participating in sexual activities. No new personality information.
- Rosa: Only mentioned in passing about the scent in the air. No new information.
- Dora: Not mentioned in these messages.
- The gymnast twins: Briefly mentioned about the Sybian but no new information.
- Jesse: Not mentioned.
- Kaylee: Not mentioned.

So only Jasmine and potentially John have some updated information, but John's updates are mainly continuing established behaviors rather than new personality developments.

Let me prepare the JSON with Jasmine and John entries, using the updated information from the lorebook that includes the new developments from these messages.</think>

debug-parser.js:28 [NT-DEBUG-RAW] Full response:
debug-parser.js:29 <think>Looking at the lorebook, I have several established characters. I need to identify which characters are mentioned in these messages and what new information is provided about them.

Key characters from the lorebook:
- Jasmine Monroe
- John Blackwood (user character)
- Jade
- Rosa
- Dora
- Jesse Walters
- Sarah Chen
- Maya Chen
- Kaylee

Messages 1-10 mention:
1. John (main character)
2. Jasmine
3. Jade
4. Twins (likely Sarah and Maya Chen)
5. Dora and Kaylee mentioned in Message 2 but not directly interacting

Let me analyze for new information:

John Blackwood:
- Already in lorebook as main character
- No significant new personality or role information in these messages

Jasmine Monroe:
- Already in lorebook
- New sexual information: being described as "little slut", "cockdumpster", "heifer" by John
- New sexual behavior: eating out Jade, admitting desire to be bred
- New relationship: being commanded by John to talk dirty to Jade

Jade:
- Already in lorebook
- New sexual information: described by John as needing to "spread her legs"
- New sexual behavior: having sex with Jasmine while John breeds Jasmine
- New relationship: being commanded by John to let Jasmine eat her out

The twins:
- Already in lorebook as Sarah Chen and Maya Chen
- No names specifically used in these messages
- New sexual information: riding Sybian while having sex

Dora and Kaylee are mentioned but don't appear to be directly interacting with anyone in these messages.

Now I'll prepare the JSON response focusing on the characters with new information:
- John Blackwood (user character always included)
- Jasmine Monroe (new sexual information and relationships)
- Jade (new sexual information and relationships)
- The twins (new sexual information, but since they're unnamed in messages I'll note them as one entry)</think>
